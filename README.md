# Triblet Sports Tournament & Game Management App

Triblet is a comprehensive **sports tournament and game management** mobile application. It allows organizers and players to create and manage tournaments, teams, and matches all in one place. Key features include real-time score updates, automatic leaderboard and standings calculations, and dynamic team/player management. The appâ€™s goal is to streamline tournament workflows (scheduling games, tracking scores, and ranking teams) to make hosting sports events easier and more engaging. 

## Features

- **Live Updates & Notifications:** Match scores and results update in real-time, ensuring all participants stay informed instantly.  
- **Automated Leaderboards:** Standings and rankings are calculated automatically based on game results, so users always see up-to-date team standings.

- **Flexible Tournament Formats:** Supports different tournament styles (round-robin, knockout, etc.) and game types, making it adaptable to various sports or competitions.  
- **Data Persistence:** Uses a backend (e.g. Firebase or Node.js/Express API) to store tournament data, scores, and user information securely.
